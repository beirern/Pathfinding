# Pathfinding

## Current Vision
* A board
  * Contains Walls (DONE)
  * Contains a Playable character and non playable character (DONE)
* Pathfinding Solutions
  * Linear (Straight Line Point A to B) path from one character to another
  * Djikstra's thing
  * A* Search (DONE)
* A toolbar on right side to pick how to draw walls

## Later Vision
* Food Pellets to pick up for points (like PacMan but less common)
* Non playable character chases player
* Non playable character will have behavior tree for different scenarios
  * Hunting for food
  * Searching for player
  * Chasing player

## Now
* Double tapping TAB will run the search (keep eye on console)
* Takes long time with a complex pathin that goes away from player, needs optimization
* Sometimes prints "DONE" 2 times, not sure why :/

## A Picture! (More for me not you :/)
